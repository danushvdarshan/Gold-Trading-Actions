This project was conducted as part of the elective course Machine Learning for Data Analysis at National Institute of Technology Calicut.

Although my specific contributions are outlined in this repository, this was a collaborative team effort. 
I sincerely acknowledge the valuable inputs and cooperation of my teammates throughout the project.

This experience strengthened our understanding of structured problem-solving, feature engineering, model development, and 
deriving actionable insights from data, while emphasizing the importance of iterative improvement and critical evaluation.
